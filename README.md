3. Problem Statement

 Lung Nodule detection using Deep Learning
The detection of lung cancer stands as a critical global health priority, emphasizing the significance of early identification for improved patient outcomes. Recent advancements in medical imaging have showcased the exceptional potential of deep learning techniques in addressing this concern. This study delves into the exploration of U-Net and DenseNet, two influential deep learning models, for the task of lung cancer detection using medical imaging data. The proposed methodology harnesses U-Net, a convolutional neural network (CNN) known for its adeptness in semantic segmentation, and DenseNet, a hybrid architecture characterized by dense connections among layers, to automate lung cancer detection from 3D computed tomography (CT) scans.
